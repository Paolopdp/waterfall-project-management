## 3. Series of Prompts for a Code-Generation LLM

Below are the individual, detailed prompts. Each prompt is self-contained, builds upon previous steps, and ends with wiring components together. All code and tests should follow best practices and use incremental TDD.

---

### **Prompt 1: Initialize Project Repository and Base Structures**

```text
# Prompt 1: Initialize Project Repository and Base Structures

We are starting the project "SOTA Open Source Resource Management Tool for IT Waterfall Projects" with two main components: a Rust backend and a Next.js frontend.

Please generate instructions and code to:

1. Initialize a Git repository with a proper .gitignore for Rust, Node.js, and Docker files.
2. Create the following directory structure:
   - /backend (Rust project)
   - /frontend (Next.js project)
3. For the backend:
   - Initialize a new Rust project using Cargo.
   - Set up a minimal web server (using Actix-Web or Rocket) with a basic health check endpoint (e.g., GET /health that returns a simple JSON response).
   - Include an initial test for the health check endpoint.
4. For the frontend:
   - Bootstrap a new Next.js project.
   - Create a basic landing page that displays "Welcome to the IT Waterfall Resource Manager".
5. Provide a short README outlining the project structure.

End the prompt by ensuring the backend and frontend are independent but ready for integration in future steps.
```

---

### **Prompt 2: Build the Core API Foundation with Data Models and Database Integration**

```text
# Prompt 2: Build the Core API Foundation with Data Models and Database Integration

Building on the base project structure from Prompt 1, please perform the following:

1. In the Rust backend:
   - Set up PostgreSQL integration using an ORM (e.g., Diesel or SQLx).
   - Create initial data models for "User" and "Project" with appropriate fields.
   - Write migrations to create the corresponding tables in PostgreSQL.
2. Implement basic CRUD endpoints for the Project model (e.g., create, read, update, delete).
3. Write unit tests for the data models and CRUD operations.
4. Ensure the endpoints return appropriate HTTP responses and error messages.

Wire the new endpoints into the existing API routing, and ensure all tests pass.
```

---

### **Prompt 3: Implement JWT-Based Authentication and Role-Based Access Control**

```text
# Prompt 3: Implement JWT-Based Authentication and Role-Based Access Control

Continuing from Prompt 2, add authentication and authorization to the backend:

1. Implement user registration and login endpoints in the Rust backend.
   - Registration should create a new User record.
   - Login should verify user credentials and return a JWT token.
2. Add middleware to secure protected endpoints using JWT validation.
3. Define roles (e.g., Project Sponsor, Project Manager, Developer, QA Engineer) within the User model and enforce role-based permissions in API endpoints.
4. Write tests for:
   - Successful and unsuccessful registration/login.
   - Access control: ensuring endpoints require proper roles/permissions.
5. Ensure the authentication system is well integrated with existing CRUD endpoints (e.g., only authorized users can create or update projects).

End by wiring the authentication middleware into the routing so that subsequent endpoints are secured.
```

---

### **Prompt 4: Develop Endpoints for the Project Lifecycle Management**

```text
# Prompt 4: Develop Endpoints for the Project Lifecycle Management

Now that the core API and authentication are in place, please add endpoints to manage the IT Waterfall Project lifecycle. Specifically:

1. Implement endpoints for each lifecycle phase:
   - **Proposal & Initiation:** Submit project proposals, assess feasibility.
   - **Requirements Analysis:** Capture functional/non-functional requirements.
   - **System & Software Design:** Submit design documents and architecture diagrams.
   - **Implementation/Development:** Create and assign tasks/milestones.
   - **Integration & Testing:** Log testing reports and integration results.
   - **Deployment/Release:** Record final approval and deployment details.
   - **Maintenance & Project Closure:** Archive documents and project reviews.
2. Each endpoint should:
   - Validate incoming data.
   - Log actions for audit purposes.
   - Return clear success/failure messages.
3. Write integration tests that simulate a complete project lifecycle flow through the endpoints.

Wire these endpoints into the existing API routing, ensuring they adhere to authentication and RBAC rules.
```

---

### **Prompt 5: Build the Next.js Frontend for Core Project Interaction**

```text
# Prompt 5: Build the Next.js Frontend for Core Project Interaction

With a functional backend in place, expand the frontend to interact with the API:

1. In the Next.js frontend:
   - Create a project dashboard that fetches and displays a list of projects from the backend.
   - Build a form for submitting a new project proposal. Ensure the form validates input and shows error messages if necessary.
2. Implement API integration:
   - Write services to call the backend endpoints securely, including handling JWT tokens for authentication.
   - Ensure that the health check endpoint and initial CRUD endpoints are consumed correctly.
3. Write unit tests for the frontend components using Jest and React Testing Library.
4. Wire the new components into the main navigation and ensure a smooth integration with existing pages.

Finish by verifying that the dashboard and form components work together and communicate successfully with the backend.
```

---

### **Prompt 6: Integrate Collaboration Features and Reporting**

```text
# Prompt 6: Integrate Collaboration Features and Reporting

Now, extend both backend and frontend to support advanced collaboration and reporting:

1. In the Rust backend:
   - Create endpoints for discussion forums (threads, comments, attachments) and document management (versioning, approvals).
   - Implement endpoints for generating reports and analytics (e.g., project progress, resource utilization).
2. Write tests for these new endpoints, ensuring they integrate with the existing lifecycle and RBAC systems.
3. In the Next.js frontend:
   - Develop UI components for forums, document upload/review, and report dashboards (e.g., Gantt charts, KPIs).
   - Integrate real-time notifications (simulate with polling or websockets) for task updates and discussion replies.
   - Write tests for these new UI components.
4. Wire all new features into the application’s navigation and ensure they are accessible only to users with the proper roles.

Ensure all components (backend endpoints, UI components, notifications, and reports) are well integrated and tested.
```

---

### **Prompt 7: Final Integration, CI/CD Setup, and Documentation**

```text
# Prompt 7: Final Integration, CI/CD Setup, and Documentation

For the final phase, we need to tie everything together and prepare for deployment:

1. Ensure that:
   - All backend endpoints are fully integrated with authentication, RBAC, and logging.
   - The Next.js frontend properly consumes every API endpoint and displays real-time updates.
2. Set up Docker:
   - Create Dockerfiles for both the Rust backend and Next.js frontend.
   - Define a Docker Compose file (or Kubernetes configuration) to run both containers together.
3. Configure CI/CD:
   - Write scripts or configuration files (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automate tests, builds, and deployments.
4. Update the README and developer documentation:
   - Include API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI definitions).
   - Provide instructions for setting up the development environment, running tests, and deploying the application.
5. Write end-to-end tests that simulate a complete user workflow from login to project closure.

Wire every component together and ensure that the integrated system is ready for final testing and deployment.
```

By following these prompts sequentially, a code-generation LLM will generate small, manageable pieces of code and tests that build upon each other. Each prompt ends with wiring the new functionality into the existing codebase, ensuring no orphaned or dangling components. This incremental, test-driven approach adheres to best practices and enables robust, maintainable development.
