Below is the comprehensive developer-ready specification based on our brainstorming session:

---

# Developer-Ready Specification

**Project:** SOTA Open Source Resource Management Tool for IT Waterfall Projects
**Technologies:**

- **Backend:** Rust
- **Frontend:** Next.js

---

## 1. Overview

This project is a state-of-the-art open source resource management tool designed specifically for IT projects following the waterfall methodology. It aims to help organizations of all sizes navigate, manage, and oversee projects through structured, phase-driven workflows. The system emphasizes robust project planning, resource allocation, team collaboration, and integrated reporting to ensure that every phase—from proposal through project closure—is executed with precision.

---

## 2. Architecture & Technology Choices

### Backend (Rust)

- **Rationale:** Leverage Rust’s performance, memory safety, and concurrency for backend logic.
- **API Design:** Develop a RESTful API that handles project lifecycle management, role-based access control, and integration with collaboration modules.
- **Data Storage:** Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store project data, document versions, user roles, and logs.
- **Security:** Implement authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization middleware to enforce role-based permissions.

### Frontend (Next.js)

- **Rationale:** Utilize Next.js for its server-side rendering capabilities, SEO benefits, and dynamic routing.
- **UI Components:** Build responsive interfaces for dashboards, Gantt charts, calendars, collaboration tools, and real-time notifications.
- **State Management:** Consider using a state management library (like Redux or Context API) for managing application state across components.
- **API Integration:** Consume the Rust API endpoints securely and efficiently.

### Integration & Deployment

- **Deployment Strategy:** Containerize both backend and frontend applications (e.g., Docker) and consider orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) for scalability.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement automated testing and deployment pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.
- **Microservices or Monolith:** Start with a modular monolith to manage complexity, with clear API contracts that can later be split into microservices if needed.
